// INSTRUCTIONS
// The museum of incredible dull things
// The museum of incredible dull things wants to get rid of some exhibitions. Miriam, the interior architect, comes up with a plan to remove the most boring exhibitions. She gives them a rating, and then removes the one with the lowest rating.

// However, just as she finished rating all exhibitions, she's off to an important fair, so she asks you to write a program that tells her the ratings of the items after one removed the lowest one. Fair enough.

// Task
// Given an array of integers, remove the smallest value. Do not mutate the original array/list. If there are multiple elements with the same value, remove the one with a lower index. If you get an empty array/list, return an empty array/list.

// Don't change the order of the elements that are left.


// SOLUTION

function removeSmallest(numbers) {
  let indexOfMin = numbers.indexOf(Math.min(...numbers))
  return numbers.filter((num, index) => index != indexOfMin)
}

// TEST CASES
console.log(removeSmallest([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), [2, 3, 4, 5], "Wrong result for [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]");
console.log(removeSmallest([5, 3, 2, 1, 4]), [5, 3, 2, 4], "Wrong result for [5, 3, 2, 1, 4]");
console.log(removeSmallest([2, 2, 1, 2, 1]), [2, 2, 2, 1], "Wrong result for [2, 2, 1, 2, 1]");
console.log(removeSmallest([]), [], "Wrong result for []");
