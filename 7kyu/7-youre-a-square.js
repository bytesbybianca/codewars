// INSTRUCTIONS
// You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

// However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

// Task
// Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

// In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

// The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.


// SOLUTION

var isSquare = function(n){
  if(n < 0) {
    return false
  } else if(n === 0) {
    return true
  } else if(n > 0) {
    return Math.sqrt(n) == Math.sqrt(n).toFixed(0) ? true : false
  }
}


// // TEST CASES
console.log(isSquare(-1), false, "-1: Negative numbers cannot be square numbers");
console.log(isSquare( 0), true, "0 is a square number (0 * 0)");
console.log(isSquare( 3), false, "3 is not a square number");
console.log(isSquare( 4), true, "4 is a square number (2 * 2)");
console.log(isSquare(25), true, "25 is a square number (5 * 5)");
console.log(isSquare(26), false, "26 is not a square number");
